# Bank Branch

This project aims to simulate some basic operations in a bank branch. 
Operations that are performed by customers, such as withdrawals, deposits, transfers, among others.

## Getting Started

These instructions will cause you to have a copy of this project on your machine, either for development or testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to run the project.
```
Git
IntelliJ IDEA
Maven
Postman
DockerCompose
PostgreSQL
```

### Installing

We will now start a step by step how to run the project on your computer and test.

Cloning the repository to your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/carlosmoraiszup/bankbranch.git
```
After cloned repository, open a terminal from within the project folder.
With docker installed and configured, boot it by running:
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

After that, just open the project in IntelliJ and wait for maven to download the 
dependencies and then just run the project.

## Deployment

The account balance can never be negative;
It can not be possible to make a withdrawal or transfer when the balance in the account is insufficient;
The target account must be valid;
The client can only have one account (validate by CPF for example);
When creating the account in the success answer should include the account Id for future
movements;
When requesting an extract, you must include all account movements, such as
transfer, deposit and withdrawal;
When requesting a transfer, both the destination and the source account must be
valid;
It may not be possible to make a transfer for yourself, that is, account
can not be the same as the destination account;
To perform operations as findAll, delete e update, you must have ADMIN profile;
You must log in before performing any operations;

## Carrying out the tests
With the project running, open POSTMAN.
Copy the collection link that is just below.
```
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/a4be40da08466875c1f8
```
with POSTMAN open, click File -> Import -> [Import from link]
paste the link and hit import. Ready, you already have the test collection.

## Endpoints
### Token-free endpoints

* **[POST] localhost:8080/login**
* **[POST] localhost:8080/customers/register**
* **[POST] localhost:8080/operations/depositIntoAccount/{numberAccount}**

### Endpoints that require token and profile is customer or admin

* **[GET] localhost:8080/customers/viewProfileData**
* **[GET] localhost:8080/operations/findAccountBalance**
* **[POST] localhost:8080/operations/withdrawIntoAccount**
* **[POST] localhost:8080/operations/transferMoneyTo/{numberAccount}**
* **[GET] localhost:8080/operations/extractAccount**

### Endpoints that require token and profile is only admin

* **[GET] localhost:8080/customers/findAll**
* **[POST] localhost:8080/customers/update**
* **[DELETE] localhost:8080/customers/deleteByCPF/{CPF}**

## Attention

If you do not have a registration, you should open the folder: [Customers -> register]

After registering the customer. Login must be done in order to generate an access token.

![Login Example1](imagens/login.png)

Copy the token as shown in the. Remember that for any operation that is to be performed,
the token must be placed. It also has an expiration time;

Here is an example to perform a withdraw. 
First place the token as shown in the image in Headers and shortly after, in Body, enter the value of the serve.
